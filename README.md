# Noise Explorer 

## TLDR; 
This is a repo containing my experimentation with Bevy and the Noise Crates in Rust. It is not meant to be a definitive example of how to write rust but if it helps anyone then great. 

The code will get more organised as I progress and experiment with how Bevy works. I will try to add in best practices and keep the code up-to-date but 

## Goal 
My goal for this project is two fold:

* Understand 'Noise' and what the Noise crate provides
* To understand how to structure the project in Bevy
* experiment with EGUI
